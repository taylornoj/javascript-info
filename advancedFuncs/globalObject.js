//// GLOBAL OBJECT ////

// global object provides variables and functions that are available anywhere
// in a browser it is named window

// all properties are of the global object can be accessed directly:
alert("Hello");
// is the same as
window.alert("Hello");

// but global functions and variables are declared with var, not let/const,
// so global variables are generally discouraged
